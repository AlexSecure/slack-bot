This script is designed to facilitate communication within a Slack application, specifically tailored
for conducting security testing level determination. It includes a detailed framework for assessing
security testing requirements based on a scoring system. The script defines constants and a namedtuple
for structured message formatting, along with a series of functions to create Slack message blocks,
calculate scores, and format messages for both Slack and JIRA integrations.
